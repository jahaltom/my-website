      <h2>Quantum Random Number Generator</h2>
      <p>This script generates a true 16-bit random seed by running a quantum circuit on real IBM Quantum hardware. It creates a quantum circuit with 16 qubits, applies Hadamard gates to place them into superposition, and measures the result to extract inherently random bits — a process governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. The resulting binary string is converted into an integer seed, which is then used to initialize NumPy’s random number generator, providing quantum entropy for simulations, machine learning, or cryptographic applications.</p>

      <h2>Advanced Machine Learning Analysis</h2>
      <p>​A comprehensive analytical pipeline investigating the association between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants and preterm birth (PTB). The study integrates a diverse array of data types, including mtDNA variants, mitochondrial haplogroups, nuclear DNA principal components (nDNA PCs), maternal body mass index (BMI), and socioeconomic and environmental metadata.​ The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of the dataset. Subsequently, feature selection is performed using various machine learning models, such as Random Forests (RF), Neural Networks (NN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Regression models, to identify the most informative features related to PTB outcomes. The final phase involves training and evaluating predictive models to assess their performance in classifying or predicting PTB based on the selected features.​ By integrating mitochondrial genetic data with maternal and environmental factors, this project aims to uncover potential biomarkers and enhance the understanding of the complex interplay between genetics and environmental influences in preterm birth.</p>
